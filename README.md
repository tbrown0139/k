## Mission Objectives

UserFrosting seeks to balance modern programming principles, like DRY and MVC, with a shallow learning curve for new developers.  Our goals are to:

- Create a fully-functioning user management script that can be set up in just a few minutes
- Make it easy for users to quickly adapt the code for their needs
- Introduce novice developers to best practices such as separation of concerns and DRY programming
- Introduce novice developers to modern constructs such as front-end controllers, RESTful URLs, namespacing, and object-oriented modeling
- Build on existing, widely used server- and client-side components
- Clean, consistent, and well-documented code

## Why UserFrosting?

This project grew out of a need for a simple user management system for my tutoring business, [Bloomington Tutors](https://bloomingtontutors.com).  I wanted something that I could develop rapidly and easily customize for the needs of my business.  Since my [prior web development experience](http://alexanderweissman.com/projects/) was in pure PHP, I decided to go with the PHP-based UserCake system.

Over time I modified and expanded the codebase, turning it into the UserFrosting project.  This latest version (0.3.0) represents a major break from the original architecture of UserCake.  We now use a fully object-oriented data model and a front controller for URL routing.
